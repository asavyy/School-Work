# School-Work
This is a collection of some of the school work I have done throughout the years. This will change as I approach graduation with new and more advanced programs and assignments! If you have any questions or want to see specific work I have done, please email me.
Thank you for taking the time to go through and view my selective work!
If you are a student, professor, or individual at a teaching institution, I ask that you please do not copy my work.
