In this final project, me and 2 other group members were tasked with creating an entire database using the ProjectUniversityDescription. 

We had several parts to this assignment, including boiling down what tables and attributes to make. Defining specific relationships for said tables and attributes.

Determining foreign keys, primary keys, candidate keys, and more.
