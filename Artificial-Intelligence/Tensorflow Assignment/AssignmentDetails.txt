Design a deep neural network in tensor flow with 4 inputs and 4 outputs

Inputs:

Health: integer 0,1,2

Has-Knife: boolean 0,1

Has-Gun: boolean 0,1

Enemies: integer

 

Outputs:

Attack: boolean

Run: boolean

Wander: boolean

Hide: boolean

Be sure to have only 1 value of true in the outputs for each data set.

Train your network and try the following test values once your network is trained:

2111 Action Attack
1112 Action Hide
0000 Action Wander
0111 Action Hide
2013 Action Hide
2103 Action Hide
0103 Action Run
 

Show your results.

Please turn in:

1) Text file with Sharable link or put sharable link in the description

2) ipynb file

3) csv or text file with  your data

I added the file extensions:  zip,csv,txt,ipynb
