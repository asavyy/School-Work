Fix your programs if necessary. 

Your program should

evolve and improve 
produce valid schedules
compute correct fitness values 
Use the baseline values of N=50, Pc =0.75, Pm=0.05.  

Add code to your project to compute to track fitness through each generation.  Provide the ability to export the Min fitness, Max fitness, and average fitness for each generation.

 

Graph questions
Plot out the Min, Max, and Average Fitness.  I suggest using Excel.
1) What can you conclude about the charts?

2) How quickly does your population converge?

3) Does it prematurely converge?

4) What can you conclude?

 

 

Part 1 Schedule evolution

Run your program 5 times with max generations = 2000 (you may go higher if needed).  Run it 5 times with max generations of 50.  

-Is your schedule evolving and is your fitness getting better?  Is your fitness better in generation 50?

 

Part 2 Crossover variations

Run the GA 4 more times using baseline values except use the values of  Pc = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0. Plot out the Max, and Average Fitness. for each run.  X Generation number, Y Axis Fitness Fitness (max and avg).  Note you will have 4 graphs.

Part 3  Mutation variations section

Run the GA 5 more times using baseline values except use the values of  Pm = 0.001, 0.002, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1.  Plot out the Max, and Average Fitness. for each run.  X Generation number, Y Axis Fitness Fitness (max and avg).  Note you will have 5 graphs.

Part 4  Population variations section

Run the GA 6 more times using baseline values except use the values of  N = 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000. Plot out the Max, and Average Fitness. for each run.  X Generation number, Y Axis Fitness Fitness (max and avg).  Note you will have 6 graphs.
