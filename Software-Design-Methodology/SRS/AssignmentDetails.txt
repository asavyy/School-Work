Your team has decided to make a crypto currency tracking mobile app for iOS and Android.    You have done an initial brain storm and recorded the initial vision for the app shown below.  It is now time to write a formal SRS so that developers have a clear scope of what is needed to be coded.    Your team may not know much about cryptocurrency but your team realizes that this could be  a profitable app.  Your team will need to learn the domain of basic cryptocurrency and trading.    Since this was your team's idea, you will need to expand the features and get clarity.  The main features are below but you will find that you need to also add more features and requirements.

Your team should write an SRS.  Make it as complete as possible.   We have seen example of SRS documents:

Use cases
State Diagrams
Wire flows
Class diagrams
functional requirements
non functional requirements
interface requirements
descriptions
system features
list of terms
