The following program is a program designed to implement the Strategy Pattern. 
The example used is the sport baseball.
Upon running this program, the user will be faced with output detailing the methods of the
created classes within the program and how they come together to define specific roles in baseball
such as: A pitcher, a pinch hitter, a batter, and a fielder.

To run the following source code via Command Prompt:

1.) Extract the source code.
2.) Open command prompt
3.) Using cd within Command Prompt, change the directory to whereever you extracted
the source code to. For example, if we extracted the source code to our documents folder, the command would be:

cd C:\Users\xxxxx\Documents\BaseballAssignment\src

4.)Once the directory is changed, type the following command to compile the main class of the source code:

javac baseball.java

5.) If no errors pop up, the code has compiled. In the event of a JNI error, your JRE is out of date with
the version of Java you used to compile the source. This likely should not happen.

6.) Once the java file is properly compiled, type in this command:

java baseball

7.) The program should execute with desired output. Once you are done using the source code you may
type this command to exit command prompt:

exit

Thank you!
