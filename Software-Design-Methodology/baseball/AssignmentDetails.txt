Create a program to manage baseball players.

There will be several types of baseball players { pitchers, batters, fielders, and catcher }.  All of the players throw, catch, and bat differently. 

For example,

 batting - you can swing for contact, swing for power, bunt, or you might not bat.

throwing - you can throw by pitching, throw by throwing to another fielder, or you might not throw

catching - you can catch with a regular globe, catchers mitt, or with your bare hands.

 

Furthermore, your behaviors might need changed during a game.  For example,  a pitcher might bat if he is in the National League. Conversely, pitchers do not bat in the American League.  A player's batting, throwing, catching must be able to be change at run time.

 

Implement the program in java or C# to yield the output shown.  Your design and implementation should be elegant and must use the Strategy Pattern.  

Pitchers:  Throw by throwing the ball to the catcher.  Catch by using a regular glove.  Swing by not batting.

Batters:  Do not throw.  Use bare hands to catch the ball.  Swing by focusing on contact.

Fielders: Quickly throw the ball to another fielder.  Catch by using a regular glove.  Swing by not batting.

Catcher:  Throw by throwing the ball back to the pitcher. Catch by catching the balls thrown by a pitcher.  Swing by not batting.

Pinch Hitter: Throw by not throwing.  Catch by not catching.   Swing by swinging for power.

Display() will display the players name.

PerformCatch() will output text that simulates the catch action.  PerformThrow() and PerfomBat() similarly output text on the action.

Programs must compile and run at the command line using:

javac  *.java

java baseball

I will not be installing any extras software, IDEs such as eclipse, netbeans, jcreator to run your programs.  Note that your main class needs to be called baseball (all lowercase).

 Console.WriteLine("Kent the pitcher will not bat any more because we have a pinch hitter.");
 kent.SetBattingBehavior(new BatWithNothing());
 kent.Display();
 kent.PerformBat();

 PinchHitter bobcat = new PinchHitter();
 bobcat.SetName("Bobcat");
 bobcat.Display();
 bobcat.PerformThrow(); 
 bobcat.PerformCatch();
 bobcat.PerformBat();
 }
