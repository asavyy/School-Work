Software engineering is a team discipline. The purpose of this course is to introduce the principles of software
engineering and to provide experience in teamwork. The course is structured around a major project, which is
taken through the stages of cost estimation, requirements specification, design and implementation, and testing.

We were given a series of projects, including a final project, which will be detailed in the folders above.
