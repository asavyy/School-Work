"cons">I had many issues with UPJ. This was the worst job to accept and I regret it everyday of my life. The upper management is terrible. They make decisions that don&#x27;t make sense or to only benefit them, not the people below them. On my level, I didn&#x27;t feel supported in my role. I wanted to learn more but I was always told that I had to know everything already. My supervisor did not support me and my coworkers were toxic. The benefits were terrible and I never took a day off because of the awful vacation package. Do not work at UPJ unless you want the world of higher education to be ruined forever. I am never going back into the field because of this unorganized soul sucking &quot;university. &quot;
"pros">I like working as a tutor at Pitt Johnstown because my hours were scheduled around my class schedule. As a public speaking tutor I can increase my public speaking skills. When no one needs tutored, I can do my homework.
"cons">There is not many cons to working as a public speaking tutor. I can only get 3 hours a week because of my class scedule. The hourly wage is not the best.
"pros">UPJ has a good work environment. 
The student body has some excellent students. 
The campus is beautiful and in a great location for learning. 
The department is very good. My colleagues are great to work with.
"cons">Johnstown itself is very small, so you might get bored.
It is very cold in the winters here, so make sure you&#x27;re okay with that.
The pay could be better, but you aren&#x27;t in academia to make money!

"pros">Great co-workers, beautiful campus, good benefits
"cons">The president is a paranoid egomaniac who keeps all power and information at the very top, creating an environment of continual uncertainty. He moves staff in-between departments with no overlap for training or consideration to what said employees want, creating disgruntled staff and inefficiencies.
"pros">A lot of room to advance in the company
"cons">Working as a full time student caused some schedueling conflicts
