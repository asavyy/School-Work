a beautiful campus
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
It's a small school but a good one. Very nice people on campus. It's a beautiful campus.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown not only has a beautiful campus, but great academics as well. The campus is mostly covered with tall attractive trees and surrounded by open land and the woods. The buildings are of great condition and modern design. The professors at Johnstown try their best to not only teach the class well, but also keep the students involved and on there toes. The university also tries to get each student involved in numerous peer building exercises and community service.

The campus is very nice. Fall season in Johnstown is gorgeous, but winters are brutal. The class sizes here are very small which is nice. Faculty on campus, such as administrative positions are not vert helpful. Food, everyday, is a hit or miss, on campus. Off campus there is really nothing to do other than go to Walmart.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
UPJ is a beautiful campus. It is surrounded by trees, so it is like it is in the middle of the woods, but it is less than 10 minutes from Walmart and the mall. The campus has a gym with an indoor track and a rock climbing wall. Classes are close to each other and takes no less than 5 minutes to walk to class.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
Overall, University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown is a decent school. The academics are great particularly for nursing and engineering majors. Besides that, the campus resembles a highschool due to it's small environment and student population. The surrounding town is vehemently dangerous. Most of the students here lack true education on current events, even past, that are happening in our society. I sense a lack of community here as well. Disregarding the bad here, the class sizes and student to teacher ratio are promising. Students are able to develop a professional relationship with their professors and most professors are easily accessible if a student needs help.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
If you plan on going to this school you should know that there is almost absolutely nothing to do at all. If you participate in Greek Life it's like they are constantly trying to shut down all of the organizations on campus over things that are no big deal.... Extremely boring campus to the point that if you're trying to have fun you're just better off to go home and hang out with your parents instead of staying on campus for the weekend.... Another thing is that Johnstown is one of the heaviest plagued areas of the heroin epidemic so if you are looking to have a nice area to go to do things you're not going to have anything safe to go to besides just being on campus... (Where there is nothing to do). 1/10 would not recommend unless you are going there to have no friends and just get a degree instead of having a fun experience at college.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
I believe that Pitt Johnstown is a great campus for students entering any major. The professors are experts in their field and are always willing to help students in need. Our facilities and housing are great on campus and make my college experience great.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
I love the class size and the willingness of professors to want to connect with their students. Professors are very willing to meet with students at any time to help in any way possible. The atmosphere on campus is great, everyone is friendly. There are plenty of activities and clubs to get involved in and the academics are highly rated. They provide the same material that the University of Pittsburgh does, just in a smaller class setting.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
It is a very great school. Everyone is so nice and helpful. The professors are great and always ready to help a student in need and the students and other faculty members are really nice and helpful too. This school is a really nice place for upcoming students like me. I feel like I already belong here and that I am ready to learn and excel in my education there.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
UPJ is a great place to learn and has many activities for students to grow and make friends. 
There is a lot to do on and off campus, the food isn't terrible, but it could always be better. 
The community on and off campus is small but perfect for people who don't enjoy the city life.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
It is a good campus and a good place to receive an education. The Professors are nice, and students are able to meet with them during their office hours. The Campus is beautiful, and the classrooms are nice, as are the dorm rooms. There is a wide variety of classes to take and clubs to join.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
If I had the option, I would have given UPJ half of a star. I attended UPJ for a year and then transferred to a different school. The school is extremely  small and most students are commuters, so there is barely anyone on campus during the weekends. There are not many opportunities here or extra curricular, so it is easy to get bored here. There are a few students who enjoy going here, but most are unhappy.  If you are looking for a real and fulfilling college experience, do not go here.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
I think it is a great school academically and allows for a student to excel. There is not much to do in the area, but it is small enough to get to know new people. I have met amazing people there and feel so safe on campus. I know that there are professors that care about me and my growth and I am super blessed to have had them in class.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
I am a future student at the University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown. When I visited the campus, I felt like I was at home.  Unlike other colleges, I actually felt safe at this place. The classroom sizes are the size of a typical high school class. They have excellent food as well. They have one of the highest reputations for academics around where I live. I am very excited to be attending here in the fall.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
I love my campus. The people here are really nice and so are the professors. The food is good on certain days, but there are plenty of different dining options in the Union as well as off-campus. There is always something going on somewhere, just have to keep your eyes open for them.
https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
UPJ is a good place to go to college if you want somewhere who will push you to your academic best. It is a lot of work, but after all, you end up graduating with University of Pittsburgh on your diploma, and around here that will get you very far. The class sizes are small which makes the professors easily accessible whenever you need them and that is great. Everyone gets to know everyone and that can open more doors up for you in the future.

My experience with University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown was that of a full-time student on campus.  Online learning not applicable.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
The good points about University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown were the faculty.  Every professor and AP in the Computer Science discipline were knowledgeable in the field and always available after class for questions and other help.  Facilities are also very nice and well kept.  The computer labs specifically in Blackington Hall were very open to both Comptuer Science major and non-CS major students, with student helpers available for random questions with assignments when needed.  
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
During this crazy time with Covid-19 Johnstown did everything possible to make it an enjoyable time on campus for the students along with keeping everyone safe. The campus is beautiful, the classrooms are very well kept, and the professors are great.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
Most of my classes towards the end of the semester were online. The professors did everything they could to make our learning experience as best as it could be under the circumstances we are in. I did very well in my classes even when they were online.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
The online experience feels just like you are in school but in the comfort of your own home. Some teachers are very understanding and will help you on their own time.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
UPJ is a wonderful university that is full of life and diversity. The teachers here are amazing and are always ready to help their students!
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
Despite COVID-19, the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown did a great job of welcoming us. There was still stuff for us to do on campus, just at a limited capacity.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
Almost all professors did a great job of transitioning to mostly online learning. We started to use Canvas this year, and most of them did a great job of incorporating that.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
Professors work with students to help them learn their best while online. It&#x2019;s like I haven&#x2019;t left the classroom, it feels like I&#x2019;m in class.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
Small college with amazing benefits. Friendly professors and staff that want the best for all students.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
The University of Pittsburgh - Johnstown had a great, small-town campus. I enjoyed the small class sizes and the individualized attention from the professors. Professors here really invest in their student&apos;s academic journey and often go out of their way to help them succeed. One area that I think could use some improvement is a stronger emphasis on career development and fostering professional contacts in different cities.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
All of the courses I took at the University of Pittsburgh - Johnstown were in-person classes, so I do not feel qualified to supply a rating in this area.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
Due to the COVID-19 situation, myself along with many college and high school students had to adjust to online coursework.  My
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
I knew as soon as I walked on campus there was no other college for me.  The campus is so warm and inviting.  The secluded, quiet country setting was exactly what I wanted.  Having grown up in the country, the campus felt like home.  The campus is clean and well-maintained.  The dorms/townhouses are cozy and comfortable.  The staff is knowledgeable and always willing to help.  As a nursing student, I was excited to know I would obtain a Pitt main degree while attending a branch campus.  I look forward to beginning my Sophomore year this fall and taking another step closer to completing my degree.  I would recommend UPJ to anyone I can!
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
I enjoy the campus atmosphere, and the small number of students making it easier to be known as a person not a number.  The location of the college  provides a lot of opportunities
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
This school is a great place to be! The campus is beautiful and not too big for those who came from small towns.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
The experience at UPJ honestly depends on what classes and professors you take. A majority of the teachers truly care about their students and want to help you move forward in your career. The campus is a nature campus with trails to explore and collect samples on for some classes. There are alarm buttons on multiple locations around the campus in case of emergency; however, I have not needed to use them. Our campus is known to have a better biology program than a lot of other schools in the surrounding area, and I was able to get a decent amount of scholarships and financial aid through their programs.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
Love it here! Its a small campus which makes for a more comfortable vibe. Made some of the best friends here, the professors are helpful. Not many electives to choose from but they are not too bad.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
I like how the campus at University of Pittsburgh- Johnstown is very laid back and quiet. It truly is a place to get away and just focus on your certain studies for your major. The teachers there are really nice and truly want to see their students succeed. They are also very understanding. Some of the teachers there are a little strange but that will happen at any school or college you decide to attend. The education is also nicely priced considering you are receiving a Pitt degree for less than half the price.
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
The professors are passionate about their professions and are extremely helpful to students. Additionally, the professors go above and beyond to help students succeed. Overall, the campus is safe. I have always been a commuter therefore, I cannot comment on the housing. However, I frequently eat lunch on campus and it is good for a college campus. The coffee shop in Blackington is great!
https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/reviews/
I am considering UPJ but I can't visit obviously. How is the food, campus life, dorms, profs, people, etc?
https://old.reddit.com/r/UPJ/comments/kb7958/thoughts_on_upj/
ell us that The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown "is about having a good college experience at a small campus while growing as a student and person." The school offers "an excellent undergraduate campus to explore scientific fields," as well as engineering and education programs that "have a high success rate." Academics focus on practical experience in most disciplines; as one student explains, "My professors have all worked in the field that they are teaching," which not only "adds validity to what they are teaching," but also means that "they can help students get internships and the experience that they need." Profs here "are generally very accessible," but their teaching can be "hit or miss." One student explains, "Some professors at UPJ are sensational, but others can be total bores. The academic experience in Johnstown is what you make of it. If you want to get the most out of it, you can." Those who succeed in doing so insist that UPJ offers "a small school feel with a big university name" that translates into "a very positive employment rate for graduating students."</p>
								</article>

								<article>
									<h4 class="bold">Student Body</h4>
									<p>UPJ undergrads are "hardworking, fun-loving individuals looking to make a difference on campus on way or another." They are "generally from western Pennsylvania," either "from the Pittsburgh or Johnstown-Somerset area," with many "who live nearby in small towns." The school is predominantly Caucasian "so ethnically, it's not very diverse," but this is something that the school is "working on." Additionally, "Many students here are engineering majors," so some find that the school also lacks diversity in terms of areas of interest. One student observes that "The typical student is a walking advertisement for Hollister. It is very preppy here. There aren't a lot of artsy, goth, or other types of people." That said, the atypical students here "fit in by banding in groups in which they recognize and celebrate each others' uniqueness."</p>
								</article>

								<article>
									<h4 class="bold">Campus Life</h4>
									<p>The weekends can get pretty boring sometimes at UPJ because "there isn't much to do in Johnstown" and "a lot of students go home on the weekends." As one student observes, "It's a rural atmosphere, so the social life reflects that. It's like choosing between living in the city and living in a small town. UPJ is the small-town choice. The safe and pleasant atmosphere compensates for the lack of nightlife." One perk of the location is that "We get a lot of snow, so many students enjoy going to local ski resorts or sled riding on campus." Students tell us that "there are parties every weekend," but "Although there is a majority of students who like to drink alcohol and party, it is easy to find other students that are not interested in those activities. Just because you don't drink, doesn't mean that you're not going to have any friends here." "The movies and bowling" are "always popular places for students" and it's "hard to go to either location without seeing another group of students from the university."</p>

From my first year of experience, all of my professors tried their hardest to help their students understand the material. Many, if not all, of the professors have after class hours for students who need extra help. As long as you do the work required of you, you should walk away from each class with an understanding of the material.

First of all, the campus is beautiful! It is set up on a hill and surrounded by trees, yet only a few minutes from many stores, restaurants, and etc.. There are many clubs and organizations that make an effort to get students involved on campus to make their college experience better. From the few clubs/organizations I joined my first year, I have made a few really good friends. The campus is also a very safe environment. If there is any type of threat or anything, even minor, the campus police send out emergency alerts to students via e-mail, text messages, and phone calls. The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown is not only a good school for education, it is also a great place to put yourself out there and make friends that will last a lifetime.
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
Since Pitt-Johnstown is a public school, it is a lot cheaper than private schools that can offer the same education. However, with the Pitt name, it is a little more expensive than other public schools here in Pennsylvania. There are a few costly things that are a little outrageous. For example, parking permits, meal plans, and laundry. Shouldn&#039;t laundry be free at every school? Although there are some things that are pricey, the education and experience you can receive at The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown is worth every penny.
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
Don&#039;t just sit around your dorm room and watch television or play video games! To get the full college experience, join a club or organization. It is a great way to make friends, and without friends college can be a miserable time. Get your school work done first then have fun; make friends!
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
Pitt-Johnstown is great for students who come from a small town or city. Students who attend UPJ from a big city get bored sometimes. There is a lot to do around Johnstown, but just not as much as a big city. It is also great for students who are out-going and want to make friends.
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
UPJ is a growing college that is continuously expanding among the many acres owned. Huge variety of clubs that make the college experience enjoyable. If I could choose any school to attend, I would not have changed my mind.
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
Check the campus out for sure, and ask questions to your tour guides and the advisers you meet with. Look up all the clubs that are offered, you will meet your good friends there.
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
It is not that the academics are strict or necessarily hard, but the professors are very thorough with their lessons, and if you are unable to understand a concept the professors will sit with you one on one to help you.

The freshman dorm rooms may be a tight squeeze, but the ski-lodge-like dorm promotes strong social interaction.

This is a tricky one because I usually make my own food at school, but our school does offer a few great places to eat other than the main cafeteria.

Join clubs, I am involved with 3 clubs currently. I would have been involved with more clubs if I had the time. Also, the school has Greek Life which many kids become involved with.
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
The level of help and effective teaching from the professors is an immediate quality that you will not find in larger schools. The food is quality (not jail-like) food, and the school offers many free trips to different cities and a spring concert.
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
To the lack of many students knowledge, there is a old cemetery back behind the school, beyond the sports fields, down a bike trail among the many acres for you to explore.
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
Become involved with clubs.
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
Previously explained, but once again GET INVOLVED WITH CLUBS!!! The are worth your time, and I promise you will not regret your choices.
https://www.cappex.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh-johnstown/reviews
There is Greek Life on campus, however I do not know how many of each Fraternity/Sorority there are.

Oh cmon people its not THAT bad here. Johnstown sucks if you live here, but its not bad where UPJ is located. The Cafeteria food is awful but the Tuck Shop food is good. Classes are small and most professors really care. Safety is perfectly fine. Clubs are the usual stuff. There are plenty of opportunities if you look for them.

There&#39;s actually a decent amount of parties and things to do for such a small campus, even with COVID regulations.

The campus has great and caring professors, smaller class sizes, solid but not great food, and usually good wifi. Some renovations are needed and it can get pretty cold and snowy in the winter.

I&#39;m only going here because I can commute. This place is a constant money grabber. Any chance they get they&#39;ll charge you an arm and a leg. I wish there was a rating for the faculty.

Johnstown&#39;s one of the places that tuition wise, the price is right. Most students wither love it or hate it here. The food on campus isn&#39;t all that great and the wifi&#39;s horrid. Overall the campus is decent but the actual town of Johnstown is in decline. There&#39;s not much to do in the area and one the weekends campus is practically dead.

I like the school but the location is not ideal there&#39;s more snow than I&#39;m used to and the wind makes it really cold.

https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1515

The school is great. The curriculum is on point. Professors are very helpful. Most people complain about dining just because the highest quality food they can eat is hamburgers and fried food. The dining selection is excellent with various options. The campus always has on-going event s its just up to the individual to take the opportunity.

https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1515

Some offices do not help you but send you to other individuals. The campus does not have good lighting at night. Instead of using money to update safety, they are using money to add additions, both needed and unnecessary. There is no getting out of fees that are useless to any student who lives off campus. Internet is expensive and useless.

https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1515

The professors at the university provide a quality education, classrooms and facilities are nice. The freshman dorms are outdated and internet is very bad, I found myself constantly being disconnected. Food in the dining hall is hit or miss, mostly the latter. Not much to do around campus, I either played Xbox or went home, which is what most did.

https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1515

Sometimes the weather is a mess but the university can&#39;t control that. However, the food is AWFUL. Before attending, I read reviews about the school and students were complaining about the food. I thought that it can not be so bad but no, it truly is THAT BAD.

https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1515

It is not bad, just not great. In the last few years, campus has become more strict on drinking and partying and that makes weekends very boring unless you know where to go.

"cons">I had many issues with UPJ. This was the worst job to accept and I regret it everyday of my life. The upper management is terrible. They make decisions that don&#x27;t make sense or to only benefit them, not the people below them. On my level, I didn&#x27;t feel supported in my role. I wanted to learn more but I was always told that I had to know everything already. My supervisor did not support me and my coworkers were toxic. The benefits were terrible and I never took a day off because of the awful vacation package. Do not work at UPJ unless you want the world of higher education to be ruined forever. I am never going back into the field because of this unorganized soul sucking &quot;university. &quot;
